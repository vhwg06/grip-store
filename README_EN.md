## 🚀 Deployment

> For detailed steps and env vars, see **[_workers_next/README.md](./_workers_next/README.md)**.

### ⭐ Recommended: Cloudflare Workers

High free tier, fast global access, no cold start.

👉 **[Full deployment guide → _workers_next/README.md](./_workers_next/README.md)**

### Alternative: Docker self-hosted

For VPS or your own server; local SQLite, no third-party DB.

👉 **[Docker guide → _docker/README.md](./_docker/README.md)**

### Alternative: Vercel (no longer maintained)

The Vercel edition is no longer maintained; use Workers or Docker for new deployments. For Vercel upstream sync, see `.github/workflows/sync.yml` and enable Actions write permission.

## 💡 Custom domain

For the best experience (instant payment status updates), we recommend binding a custom domain (e.g. `store.yourdomain.com`). Shared domains may be blocked by payment gateways or firewalls.

## ⚙️ Configuration & local development

Environment variables, OIDC/EPay setup, and local dev steps for the Workers edition are in **[_workers_next/README.md](./_workers_next/README.md)**.
