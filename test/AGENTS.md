# Test repository rules

- `modules/**` owns capability behavior and its executable Cucumber binding.
- `behavior.feature` is the business acceptance source.
- `behavior.steps.ts` is a thin, statically bound Cucumber automation adapter.
- Stable Scenario IDs are tags on the Scenario. `npm run test:scenario --
  @SC-MODEL-01` selects that Gherkin Scenario via Cucumber after its module
  adapter is implemented.
- Every accepted Scenario ID is declared in its module manifest. Cucumber's
  world hook resolves the feature URI and module-local steps file for that tag;
  there are no parallel native `*.spec.ts` targets.
- `shared/**` contains only cross-module plumbing.
- `generated/**` is build output and must not be edited by hand. Gherkin is
  executed directly by Cucumber; no generated Playwright-BDD source is the
  acceptance source.
- *Always follow: `Spec / Use Case → Test → Implementation → Verification`.

## Figma harness execution

- Canonical Figma harness sessions MUST use `figma-mcp-go` for Figma operations.
  Do not fall back to another Figma MCP server when `figma-mcp-go` is unavailable
  or rate-limited.
- A `figma:harness` invocation owns its complete review/repair budget and MUST
  terminate from an independent reviewer state, never immediately after writer
  mutation.
- `PASS`, `FAIL_BUDGET`, `TIMEOUT`, and `ERROR` are terminal results for the
  current harness invocation.
- Do not automatically start a new `figma:harness` invocation after
  `FAIL_BUDGET`, `TIMEOUT`, or `ERROR`. Report the terminal result and its
  artifact directory instead. A new run requires an explicit new instruction.
